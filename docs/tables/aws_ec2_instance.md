# Table: aws_ec2_instance - Query AWS EC2 Instances using SQL

The AWS EC2 Instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, eliminating the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. With EC2, you can launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_ec2_instance` table in Steampipe provides you with information about EC2 Instances within AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query instance-specific details, including instance state, launch time, instance type, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on instances, such as instances with specific tags, instances in a specific state, instances of a specific type, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the EC2 instance for you, including the instance ID, instance state, instance type, and associated tags.

## Examples

### Instance count in each availability zone
Discover the distribution of instances across different availability zones and types within your AWS EC2 service. This helps in understanding load balancing and can aid in optimizing resource utilization.

```sql+postgres
select
  placement_availability_zone as az,
  instance_type,
  count(*)
from
  aws_ec2_instance
group by
  placement_availability_zone,
  instance_type;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  placement_availability_zone as az,
  instance_type,
  count(*)
from
  aws_ec2_instance
group by
  placement_availability_zone,
  instance_type;
```

### List instances whose detailed monitoring is not enabled
