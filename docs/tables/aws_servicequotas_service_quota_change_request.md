```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  case_id,
  status,
  quota_name,
  quota_code,
  desired_value
from
  aws_servicequotas_service_quota_change_request;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  id,
  case_id,
  status,
  quota_name,
  quota_code,
  desired_value
from
  aws_servicequotas_service_quota_change_request;
```

  quota_code,
  desired_value
from
  aws_servicequotas_service_quota_change_request
where
  status = 'DENIED';
