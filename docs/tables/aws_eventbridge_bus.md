# Table: aws_eventbridge_bus - Query AWS EventBridge Buses using SQL

The AWS EventBridge Bus is a component of AWS EventBridge service, which enables the routing of events between AWS services and applications. It acts as a central hub where these events are filtered and routed to specific targets, based on rules you define. The EventBridge Bus helps in building loosely coupled, distributed applications with nearly real-time event-driven architectures.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_eventbridge_bus` table in Steampipe provides you with information about buses within AWS EventBridge. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query bus-specific details, including the bus name, ARN, policy, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on buses, such as their policies, the events they can handle, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the EventBridge bus for you, including the name, ARN, policy, and associated tags.
