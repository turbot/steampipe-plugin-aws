# Table: aws_health_event - Query AWS Health Events using SQL

The AWS Health Events service provides personalized information about events that can affect your AWS infrastructure, guiding your through scheduled changes, and accelerating troubleshooting. It aggregates and consolidates alerts and notifications from multiple AWS services into a single, easy-to-search interface. AWS Health Events also integrates with AWS Organizations to provide a centralized view of health events across all your accounts.

## Table Usage Guide

These events give you timely information about service disruptions, scheduled changes, and other important AWS-related events that can affect your services and accounts. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query event-specific details, including event type, start time, end time, and affected services. You can utilize this table to monitor your AWS services, understand the impact of AWS events, and plan necessary actions accordingly. The schema outlines the various attributes of the AWS Health Event for you, including the event ARN, event type category, service, region, start time, and end time.
