Explore your daily AWS costs by service over a period of time. This query helps you track and analyze your expenditure, aiding in better financial management and budget planning.

```sql+postgres
select
  service,
  period_start,
  blended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  amortized_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  net_unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  net_amortized_cost_amount::numeric::money
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_daily
order by
  service,
  period_start;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  service,
  period_start,
  cast(blended_cost_amount as decimal),
  cast(unblended_cost_amount as decimal),
  cast(amortized_cost_amount as decimal),
  cast(net_unblended_cost_amount as decimal),
  cast(net_amortized_cost_amount as decimal)
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_daily
order by
  service,
  period_start;
```

### Min, Max, and average daily unblended_cost_amount by service

select
  service,
  min(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as min,
  max(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as max,
  avg(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as average
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_daily
group by
  service
order by
  service;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  service,
  min(unblended_cost_amount) as min,
  max(unblended_cost_amount) as max,
  avg(unblended_cost_amount) as average
from

from 
  aws_cost_by_service_daily
group by
  service
order by
  average desc
limit 10;
```

```sql+sqlite

  avg(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as average
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_daily
group by
  service
order by
  sum desc
limit 10;
```

```sql+sqlite

with ranked_costs as (
  select
    service,
    period_start,
    unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
    rank() over(partition by service order by unblended_cost_amount desc)
  from 
    aws_cost_by_service_daily
)
select * from ranked_costs where rank <= 10;
```
