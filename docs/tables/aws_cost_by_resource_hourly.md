# Table: aws_cost_by_resource_hourly - Query AWS Cost Explorer Resource Costs using SQL

AWS Cost Explorer helps you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage. The Resource Cost feature provides detailed cost information at the individual resource level with hourly granularity, helping you identify specific resources that drive your AWS costs and understand usage patterns throughout the day.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_cost_by_resource_hourly` table provides insights into resource-level costs within AWS Cost Explorer with hourly granularity. This table allows you, as a financial analyst or cloud administrator, to query hourly cost details for specific AWS resources, helping you understand intraday spending patterns and identify cost optimization opportunities. The schema outlines various cost metrics including unblended cost, amortized cost, and usage quantity, along with resource identifiers and time periods.

**Important Notes**

- The [pricing for the Cost Explorer API](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/) is per API request - Each request you make will incur a cost of $0.01.
- By default, the table shows resource-level data with `dimension_key = 'LINKED_ACCOUNT'` and `dimension_value` set to the caller's AWS account ID for the last 14 days. Even if hourly cost allocation data is enabled in AWS Cost Explorer, resource-level data remains limited to the most recent **14 days only** and **cannot be extended beyond that**.
- This table supports optional quals. Queries with optional quals are optimised to reduce query time and cost. Optional quals are supported for the following columns:
  - `resource_id` with supported operators `=` and `<>`.
  - `dimension_key` with supported operator `=`.
  - `dimension_value` with supported operator `=`.
  - `period_start` with supported operators `=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, and `<`.
  - `period_end` with supported operators `=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, and `<`.
