## Examples

### List Users that have logged into the console in the past 90 days

```sql
select
  user_name
from
  aws_iam_credential_report
where
  password_enabled
  and password_last_used > (current_date - interval '90' day);
```

### Report of users that have NOT logged into the console in the past 90 days?

```sql
select
  user_name,
  password_last_used,
  age(password_last_used)
from
  aws_iam_credential_report
where
  password_enabled
  and password_last_used <= (current_date - interval '90' day)
order by
  password_last_used;
```

### List of users with console access that have never logged in to the console

```sql
select
    user_name
from
    aws_iam_credential_report
where
    password_status = 'never_used';
```

### Find Access Keys older than 90 days

```sql
select
  user_name,
  access_key_1_last_rotated,
  age(access_key_1_last_rotated) as access_key_1_age,
  access_key_2_last_rotated,
  age(access_key_2_last_rotated) as access_key_2_age
from
  aws_iam_credential_report
where
  access_key_1_last_rotated <= (current_date - interval '90' day)
  or access_key_2_last_rotated <= (current_date - interval '90' day)
order by
  user_name;
```

### Find users that have a console password but do not have MFA enabled

```sql
select
  user_name,
  mfa_active,
  password_enabled
from

  and not mfa_active;
```
