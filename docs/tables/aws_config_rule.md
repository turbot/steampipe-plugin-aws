# Table: aws_config_rule

An AWS Config rule represents an AWS Lambda function that you create for a custom rule or a predefined function for an AWS managed rule. The function evaluates configuration items to assess whether your AWS resources comply with your desired configurations. This function can run when AWS Config detects a configuration change to an AWS resource and at a periodic frequency that you choose (for example, every 24 hours).
