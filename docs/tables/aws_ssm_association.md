# Table: aws_ssm_association

An association is a configuration that is assigned to your managed instances. The configuration defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances. For example, an association can specify that antivirus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed. The association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is applied once or reapplied at specified times.

  association_name,
  arn,
  association_version,
  last_execution_date,

  region
from
  aws_ssm_association;
```

### List associations that have a failed status

  overview ->> 'Status' as status
from
  aws_ssm_association
where

```

### List instances targeted by the association

```sql
select
  association.association_id as association_id,
  target ->> 'Key' as target_key,
  target ->> 'Values' as target_value,
  instances
from
  aws_ssm_association as association,
  jsonb_array_elements(targets) as target,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(target -> 'Values') as instances
where
  target ->> 'Key' = 'InstanceIds';
```

### List associations with a critical compliance severity level
