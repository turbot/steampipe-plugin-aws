# Table: aws_cloudtrail_trail_event - Query AWS CloudTrail Events using SQL

AWS CloudTrail Events are records of activity within your AWS environment. This service captures all API calls for your account, including calls made via the AWS Management Console, SDKs, and CLI. It provides a history of AWS API calls for your account, including API calls made via the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and higher-level AWS services.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_cloudtrail_trail_event` table in Steampipe provides you with information about each trail event within AWS CloudTrail. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query event-specific details, including event time, event name, resources involved, and more. You can utilize this table to gather insights on trail events, such as event source, user identity, and request parameters. The schema outlines the various attributes of the CloudTrail event for you, including the event ID, event version, read only, and associated tags.

**Important Notes**
- You must specify `log_group_name` in a `where` clause in order to use this table.
- For improved performance, it is advised that you use the optional qual `timestamp` to limit the result set to a specific time period.
- This table supports optional quals. Queries with optional quals are optimised to use CloudWatch filters. Optional quals are supported for the following columns:
  - `access_key_id`
  - `aws_region` (region of the event, useful in case of multi-region trails)
  - `error_code`
  - `event_category`
  - `event_id`
  - `event_name`
  - `event_source`
  - `filter`
  - `log_stream_name`
  - `region`
  - `source_ip_address`
  - `timestamp`
  - `username`

## Examples

### List events that occurred over the last five minutes
This query is useful for gaining insights into recent activity within your AWS environment. It provides a quick overview of the events that have taken place in the last five minutes, which can be particularly useful for immediate incident response or real-time monitoring.

```sql+postgres
select
  event_name,
  event_source,
  event_time,
  user_type,
  username,
  user_identifier,
  jsonb_pretty(response_elements) as response_elements
from
  aws_cloudtrail_trail_event
where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
  and timestamp >= now() - interval '5 minutes';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  event_name,
  event_source,
  event_time,
  user_type,
  username,
  user_identifier,
  json(response_elements) as response_elements
from
  aws_cloudtrail_trail_event
where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
  and timestamp >= datetime('now', '-5 minutes');
```

### List ordered events that occurred between five to ten minutes ago
Explore the sequence of events that occurred within a specific time frame in the recent past. This can be useful for auditing activities, identifying anomalies, or tracking user behaviour within a given period.

```sql+postgres
select
  event_name,
  event_source,
  event_time,
  user_type,
  username,
  user_identifier,
  jsonb_pretty(response_elements) as response_elements
from
  aws_cloudtrail_trail_event
where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
  and timestamp between (now() - interval '10 minutes') and (now() - interval '5 minutes')
order by
  event_time asc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  event_name,
  event_source,
  event_time,
  user_type,
  username,
  user_identifier,
  json(response_elements) as response_elements
from
  aws_cloudtrail_trail_event
where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
  and timestamp between (datetime('now', '-10 minutes')) and (datetime('now', '-5 minutes'))
order by
  event_time asc;
```

### List all action events, i.e., not ReadOnly that occurred over the last hour
Explore which action events have occurred in the last hour on AWS Cloudtrail. This is useful for identifying recent activities that have potentially altered your system.

  user_type,
  username,
  user_identifier,
  jsonb_pretty(response_elements) as response_elements
from
  aws_cloudtrail_trail_event
where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
  and not read_only
  and timestamp >= now() - interval '1 hour'
order by
  event_time asc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  event_name,
  event_source,
  event_time,
  user_type,
  username,
  user_identifier,

where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
  and not read_only
  and timestamp >= datetime('now', '-1 hours')
order by
  event_time asc;
```

### List events for a specific service (IAM) that occurred over the last hour
This query allows users to monitor recent activity for a specific service, in this case, AWS's Identity and Access Management (IAM). It is particularly useful for security audits, as it provides a chronological overview of events, including who initiated them and what actions were taken, over the last hour.

from
  aws_cloudtrail_trail_event
where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
  and event_source = 'iam.amazonaws.com'
  and timestamp >= now() - interval '1 hour'
order by
  event_time asc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  event_name,
  event_source,
  event_time,
  user_type,
  user_identifier,
  json(request_parameters) as request_parameters,
  json(response_elements) as response_elements
from
  aws_cloudtrail_trail_event
where
  log_group_name = 'aws-cloudtrail-log-group-name'
