# Table: aws_inspector2_finding - Query AWS Inspector findings using SQL

The AWS Inspector is a security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. It automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices, including impacted networks, and insecure configurations. Inspector findings provide detailed information about security vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_inspector2_finding` table in Steampipe provides you with information about findings identified by AWS Inspector. This table allows you, as a security analyst, to query finding-specific details, including their severity, status, and the resources they are associated with. You can utilize this table to gather insights on potential security issues and vulnerabilities within your AWS resources. The schema outlines the various attributes of the findings, including the finding ARN, creation date, severity, status, and associated resources.

When you run an assessment with AWS Inspector, it analyzes your target resources such as EC2 instances, ECS clusters, or RDS databases and generates findings that highlight security vulnerabilities, potential misconfigurations, and other security-related issues. These findings provide you with detailed information about the identified vulnerabilities, including severity levels, affected resources, and recommended remediation steps.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore which security vulnerabilities exist in your AWS infrastructure and determine their severity and whether fixes are available. This can help prioritize remediation efforts and improve overall security posture.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  description,
  fix_available,
  inspector_score,
  severity,
  finding_account_id
from
  aws_inspector2_finding;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  description,
  fix_available,
  inspector_score,
  severity,
  finding_account_id
from
  aws_inspector2_finding;
```

### List findings with high severity
Discover the segments that have high severity findings in your AWS Inspector data. This is useful for prioritizing issues that require immediate attention due to their potential impact on your AWS resources.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  source,
  vendor_severity,
  status,
  severity
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  severity = 'HIGH';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  source,
  vendor_severity,
  status,
  severity
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  severity = 'HIGH';
```

### Count the number of findings by severity
Analyze the severity of findings from AWS Inspector to understand the distribution and frequency of issues. This can help prioritize remediation efforts based on the severity of identified problems.

```sql+postgres
select
  severity,
  count(severity)
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
group by
  severity
order by
  severity;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  severity,
  count(severity)
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
group by
  severity
order by
  severity;
```

### List findings in last 10 days
Discover the segments that have been identified as potential issues within the past 10 days through AWS Inspector. This is beneficial in maintaining system security by allowing you to promptly address any recent findings.

```sql+postgres
select
  title,
  arn,
  severity
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  last_observed_at >= now() - interval '10' day;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  title,
  arn,
  severity
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  last_observed_at >= datetime('now', '-10 days');
```

### List suppressed findings
Discover the segments that have been marked as 'suppressed' within your AWS Inspector findings. This can be particularly useful for identifying and managing potential security vulnerabilities that are currently not being addressed.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  status,
  type,
  resources,
  vulnerable_packages
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  status = 'SUPPRESSED';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  status,
  type,
  resources,
  vulnerable_packages
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  status = 'SUPPRESSED';
```

### List package vulnerability findings
Identify instances where software packages have vulnerabilities in your AWS environment. This helps in proactively addressing potential security risks in your system.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  status,
  type,
  resources,
  vulnerable_packages
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  type = 'PACKAGE_VULNERABILITY';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  status,
  type,
  resources,
  vulnerable_packages
from
  aws_inspector2_finding
where
  type = 'PACKAGE_VULNERABILITY';
```

### Get resource details of findings
Explore the specific details of identified resources within findings. This enables a deeper understanding of each finding's context and aids in subsequent decision-making processes.

```sql+postgres

  r ->> 'Type' as resource_type,
  r ->> 'Details' as resource_details,
  r ->> 'Partition' as partition,
  r ->> 'Tags' as resource_tags
from
  aws_inspector2_finding as f,
  jsonb_array_elements(resources) as r;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  f.arn as finding_arn,
  json_extract(r.value, '$.Id') as resource_id,
  json_extract(r.value, '$.Type') as resource_type,
  json_extract(r.value, '$.Details') as resource_details,
  json_extract(r.value, '$.Partition') as partition,
