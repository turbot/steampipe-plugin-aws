# Table: aws_rds_db_instance - Query AWS RDS DB Instances using SQL

Title: AWS RDS DB Instances

Description: AWS RDS DB Instances are a part of Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), which makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. They provide cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_rds_db_instance` table in Steampipe provides you with comprehensive information about each database instance within Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, database administrator, or other technical professional, to query detailed information about each DB instance, including its configuration, status, performance metrics, and other associated metadata. You can leverage this table to gather insights about DB instances, such as instance specifications, security configurations, backup policies, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the DB instance for you, including the DB instance identifier, instance class, engine version, storage type, and associated tags.

## Examples

Explore which Amazon RDS database instances are publicly accessible, along with their identifiers, classes, engines, and versions. This information can help determine areas where security might be improved by limiting public access.

```sql+postgres
select
  db_instance_identifier,
  class,
  engine,
  engine_version,
  publicly_accessible
from
  aws_rds_db_instance
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  db_instance_identifier,
  class,
  engine,
  engine_version,
  publicly_accessible
from
  aws_rds_db_instance
```

### List DB instances which are publicly accessible
Determine the areas in which your database instances are publicly accessible. This is useful for identifying potential security risks and ensuring that your data is protected.

```sql+postgres
select
  db_instance_identifier,
  publicly_accessible
from
  aws_rds_db_instance
where
  publicly_accessible;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  db_instance_identifier,
  publicly_accessible
from
  aws_rds_db_instance
where
  publicly_accessible = 1;
```

### List DB instances which are not authenticated through IAM users and roles
Identify instances where database instances are not utilizing IAM users and roles for authentication. This query is useful in highlighting potential security risks and enforcing best practices for access management.

```sql+postgres
select
  db_instance_identifier,
