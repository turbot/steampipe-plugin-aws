# Table: aws_ec2_ami_shared

An Amazon Machine Image is a special type of virtual appliance that is used to create a virtual machine within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

**You must specify an Owner ID or Image ID** in a `where` clause (`where owner_id='`), (`where image_id='`).

The `aws_ec2_ami_shared` table can list any image but you must specify `owner_id` or `image_id`.
If you want to list all of the images in your account then you can use the `aws_ec2_ami` table.

## Examples
