# Table: aws_organizations_policy_target

AWS organization policy target refers to the entity to which an organization policy is applied. It can be an AWS account or an organizational unit (OU) within the AWS organization. The policy is enforced on the specified target, defining the rules and restrictions that govern the resources and actions within that target. By setting up organization policies and assigning them to appropriate targets, administrators can effectively manage and control the AWS resources and actions within their organization.

**Note:** The `type` and `target_id` columns in this table are required to make the API call.
