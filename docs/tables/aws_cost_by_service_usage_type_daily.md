## Examples

### Basic info
Explore your daily AWS service usage and costs, sorted by service and the start of the period. This can help you understand and manage your AWS expenses more effectively.

```sql+postgres
select
  service,
  usage_type,
  period_start,
  blended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  amortized_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  net_unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  net_amortized_cost_amount::numeric::money
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_usage_type_daily
order by
  service,
  period_start;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  service,
  usage_type,
  period_start,
  CAST(blended_cost_amount AS NUMERIC) AS blended_cost_amount,
  CAST(unblended_cost_amount AS NUMERIC) AS unblended_cost_amount,
  CAST(amortized_cost_amount AS NUMERIC) AS amortized_cost_amount,
  CAST(net_unblended_cost_amount AS NUMERIC) AS net_unblended_cost_amount,
  CAST(net_amortized_cost_amount AS NUMERIC) AS net_amortized_cost_amount
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_usage_type_daily
order by
  service,
  period_start;
```



### Min, Max, and average daily unblended_cost_amount by service and usage type
Analyze your daily AWS service usage to understand the minimum, maximum, and average costs associated with each type of usage. This allows for more effective budget management and identification of potential cost-saving opportunities.

```sql+postgres
select
  service,
  usage_type,
  min(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as min,
  max(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as max,
  avg(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as average
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_usage_type_daily
group by
  service,
  usage_type
order by
  service,
  usage_type;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  service,
  usage_type,
  min(unblended_cost_amount) as min,
  max(unblended_cost_amount) as max,
  avg(unblended_cost_amount) as average
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_usage_type_daily
group by
  service,
  usage_type
order by
  service,
  usage_type;
```

### Top 10 most expensive service usage type (by average daily unblended_cost_amount)
Discover the segments that incur the highest average daily costs in your AWS services. This can help you identify areas where budget adjustments or cost optimizations might be necessary.

from 
  aws_cost_by_service_usage_type_daily
group by
  service,
  usage_type
order by
  average desc
limit 10;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  service,
  usage_type,
  sum(unblended_cost_amount) as sum,
  avg(unblended_cost_amount) as average
from 
  aws_cost_by_service_usage_type_daily
group by
  service,
  usage_type
order by
  average desc
limit 10;
```
