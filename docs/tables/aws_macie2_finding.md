# Table: aws_macie2_finding - Query AWS Macie2 Findings using SQL

AWS Macie2 is a data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS. It automatically discovers, classifies, and protects sensitive data stored in Amazon S3. The `aws_macie2_finding` table provides information about security and data privacy findings that Macie2 has generated, including details about sensitive data discovery, policy violations, and other security-related events.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_macie2_finding` table in Steampipe provides you with information about security and data privacy findings within AWS Macie2. This table allows you, as a security analyst, compliance officer, or DevOps engineer, to query finding-specific details, including the finding type, severity, status, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on findings, such as identifying sensitive data exposure, monitoring policy violations, and tracking remediation efforts. The schema outlines the various attributes of the Macie2 finding for you, including the finding ID, type, severity, status, and associated tags.
