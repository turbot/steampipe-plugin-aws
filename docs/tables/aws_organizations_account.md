# Table: aws_organizations_account

Contains information about AWS accounts that are members of the current AWS Organizations organization.

This table can only be queried using credentials from an AWS Organizations management account or a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.

Note: The `account_id` column in this table is the account ID from which the API calls are being made (often the management account). To get the described member account's ID, query the `id` column.
