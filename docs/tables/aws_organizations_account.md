# Table: aws_organizations_account - Query AWS Organizations Account using SQL

The AWS Organizations Account is a resource within AWS Organizations service that allows you to centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow and scale your AWS resources. By using AWS Organizations Account, you can create, invite, and manage accounts, set up and apply policies, and consolidate your billing. This helps you to automate AWS account creation and management, and control access to your AWS services.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_organizations_account` table in Steampipe provides you with information about each AWS account that is a member of an organization in AWS Organizations. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query account-specific details, including account status, joined method, email, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on accounts, such as accounts with specific statuses, the method used by the accounts to join the organization, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the AWS account, including the account ID, ARN, email, joined method, and status for you.

**Important Notes**
- The `account_id` column in this table is the account ID from which the API calls are being made (often the management account). To get the described member account's ID, query the `id` column.

## Examples

```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  arn,
  email,
  joined_method,
  joined_timestamp,
  name,
  status,
  tags

  id,
  name,
  arn,
  email,
  joined_method,
  joined_timestamp,
  status
from
