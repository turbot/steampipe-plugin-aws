# Table: aws_wellarchitected_lens_review_report

AWS Well-Architected Lens review report.

**Note:**
- `workload_id`, `lens_alias` and `milstone_number` are optional key column quals for the query parameter to get the improvement plans of the lens review.
- For AWS official lenses, this is either the lens alias, such as serverless, or the lens ARN, such as arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-east-1::lens/serverless. Note that some operations (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are not permitted on AWS official lenses.
- For custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef.
- The `base64_string` column value can be used to get the PDF format of the review report.
The tool(https://base64.guru/converter/decode/pdf) can be used to decode the `base64_string` value to a PDF format.
