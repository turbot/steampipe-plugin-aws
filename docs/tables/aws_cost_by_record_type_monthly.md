group by
  linked_account_id,
  record_type
order by
  linked_account_id;
```

```sql+sqlite

  period_start,
  unblended_cost_amount,
  (
    select count(*) + 1 
    from aws_cost_by_record_type_monthly as b
    where 
      a.linked_account_id = b.linked_account_id and 
      a.record_type = b.record_type and 
      a.unblended_cost_amount < b.unblended_cost_amount
  )
from 
  aws_cost_by_record_type_monthly as a;
