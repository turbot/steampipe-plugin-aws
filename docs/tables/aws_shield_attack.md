## Examples

### List all attacks detected by AWS Shield Advanced in the last 30 days

```sql+postgres
select
  resource_arn,
  start_time,
  end_time
from
  aws_shield_attack
where
  start_time between current_date - interval '30 day' and current_date;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  resource_arn,
  start_time,
  end_time
from
  aws_shield_attack
where
  start_time between date('now', '-30 day') and date('now');
```

### List the most attacked resources of the last 30 days

```sql+postgres
select
  resource_arn,
  count(*) as attacks
from
  aws_shield_attack
where
  start_time between current_date - interval '30 day' and current_date
group by
  resource_arn
order by
  attacks
desc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  resource_arn,
  count(*) as attacks
from
  aws_shield_attack
where
  start_time between date('now', '-30 day') and date('now')
group by
  resource_arn
order by
  attacks
desc;
```

### List countries from which the most requests of the attacks of the last 30 days originated

```sql+postgres
select
  top_contributor ->> 'Name' as country,
  sum(cast(top_contributor ->> 'Value' as integer)) as requests
from
  aws_shield_attack,
  jsonb_array_elements(attack_properties) as attack_property,
  jsonb_array_elements(attack_property -> 'TopContributors') as top_contributor
where
  start_time between current_date - interval '30 day' and current_date
  and attack_property ->> 'AttackPropertyIdentifier' = 'SOURCE_COUNTRY'
group by
  country
order by
  requests
desc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  top_contributor -> 'Name' as country,
  sum(cast(top_contributor -> 'Value' as integer)) as requests
from
  aws_shield_attack,
  json_each(attack_properties) as attack_property,
  json_each(attack_property -> 'TopContributors') as top_contributor
where
  start_time between date('now', '-30 day') and date('now')
  and attack_property_value_value.key = 'AttackPropertyIdentifier'
  and attack_property_value_value.value = 'SOURCE_COUNTRY'
group by
  country
order by
  requests
desc;
