# Table: aws_auditmanager_control - Query AWS Audit Manager Control using SQL

The AWS Audit Manager Control is a feature within AWS Audit Manager that allows you to evaluate how well your AWS resource configurations align with established best practices. It helps you to simplify the compliance process and reduce risk by automating the collection of evidence of your AWS resource compliance with regulations and standards. The control feature allows for continuous auditing to ensure ongoing compliance.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_auditmanager_control` table in Steampipe provides you with information about controls within AWS Audit Manager. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query control-specific details, including control source, control type, description, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on controls, such as their sources, types, descriptions, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the control for you, including the control id, name, type, source, description, and associated tags.

**Important Notes**
- This table by default returns the `Standard` controls.
- You **must** specify `type` in a `where` clause to retrieve other control types. For more information, please refer to the [list of controls by specific type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListControls.html#API_ListControls_RequestSyntax).
