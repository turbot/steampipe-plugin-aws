# Table: aws_codestar_notification_rule - Query AWS CodeStar notification rules using SQL

The AWS CodeStar notification rules allow you to set up notifications for the AWS Developer Tools, including AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, to various destinations including AWS SNS and AWS Chatbot.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_codestar_notification_rule` table in Steampipe provides you with information about notification rules. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query notification rule details, including the notification rule ARN, status, level of detail, enabled event types, as well as the ARN of the resource producing notifications and the notification targets. You can use this table to gather insights on notification rules, and combine it with other tables such as `aws_codepipeline_pipeline` to check notification rules are set up consistently.

## Examples

### Basic info
Review the configured rules and their status.
```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  resource,
  detail_type,
  status
from
  aws_codestar_notification_rule;
```

### Identify which CI/CD pipelines have notification rules
Determine which AWS CodePipeline pipelines do or do not have associated notification rules.

```sql+postgres
select 
  pipeline.name as pipeline, 
  notification_rule.name notification_rule, 
  notification_rule.status 
from 
  aws_codepipeline_pipeline as pipeline 
  left join aws_codestar_notification_rule as notification_rule on pipeline.arn = notification_rule.resource;
```

### Check for notification rules with no targets
Determine which notification rules lack targets. This query uses PostgreSQL's JSON querying capabilities to count the number of targets configured.
```sql+postgres
select
  name
from
  aws_codestar_notification_rule
where
  jsonb_array_length(targets) = 0;
```

### Name the SNS topics associated with notification rules
Determine which AWS SNS topics the notification rules are targeting. This query uses PostgreSQL's JSON querying capabilities to join on the notification rule targets. Note that due to the cross join, this query will not list notification rules that don't have any targets.

```sql+postgres
select 
  notification_rule.name as notification_rule, 
  target ->> 'TargetType' as target_type, 
  topic.title as target_topic 
from 
  aws_codestar_notification_rule as notification_rule cross 
  join jsonb_array_elements(notification_rule.targets) as target 
  left join aws_sns_topic as topic on target ->> 'TargetAddress' = topic.topic_arn;
```

By using a Common Table Expression (`with` query), it is possible to join on targets without discarding notification rules that don't have any targets.

```sql+postgres
with rule_target as (
  select 
    arn, 
    target ->> 'TargetAddress' as target_address, 
    target ->> 'TargetStatus' as target_status, 
    target ->> 'TargetType' as target_type 
  from 
    aws_codestar_notification_rule cross 
    join jsonb_array_elements(targets) as target
) 
select 
  notification_rule.name as notification_rule, 
  rule_target.target_type, 
  topic.title as target_topic 
from 
  aws_codestar_notification_rule as notification_rule 
  left join rule_target on rule_target.arn = notification_rule.arn 
  left join aws_sns_topic as topic on rule_target.target_address = topic.topic_arn;
```
