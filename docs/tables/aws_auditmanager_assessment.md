# Table: aws_auditmanager_assessment

AWS Audit Manager helps you continuously audit your AWS usage to simplify how you manage risk and compliance with regulations and industry standards. Audit Manager automates evidence collection to make it easier to assess whether your policies, procedures, and activities—also known as controls—are operating effectively. When it is time for an audit, Audit Manager helps you manage stakeholder reviews of your controls, which means you can build audit-ready reports with much less manual effort.
