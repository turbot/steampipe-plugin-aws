# Table: aws_organizations_root - Query AWS Organizations Root using SQL

AWS Organizations uses a hierarchical structure to manage accounts. At the top of this hierarchy is the "root." The root is the starting point for organizing your AWS accounts. The root acts as the parent container for all the accounts in your organization. It can also contain organizational units (OUs), which are sub-containers that can themselves contain accounts or further nested OUs.
