# Table: aws_codebuild_build - Query AWS CodeBuild Build using SQL

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. It allows you to build and test code with continuous scaling and enables you to pay only for the build time you use. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_codebuild_build` table in Steampipe provides you with information about builds in AWS CodeBuild. This table allows you as a DevOps engineer to query build-specific details, including build statuses, source details, build environment, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on builds, such as build status, source version, the duration of the build, and more. The schema outlines for you the various attributes of the CodeBuild build, including the build ID, build status, start and end time, and associated tags.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore which AWS CodeBuild projects have been completed and gain insights into their build status, duration, and other related details. This can help in managing and optimizing the build processes in your AWS environment.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  id,
  build_complete,
  timeout_in_minutes,
  project_name,
  build_status,
  encryption_key,
  end_time,
  region
from
  aws_codebuild_build;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  id,
  build_complete,
  timeout_in_minutes,
  project_name,
  build_status,
  encryption_key,
  end_time,
  region
from
  aws_codebuild_build;
```

### List encrypted build output artifacts
Discover the segments that include encrypted build output artifacts, allowing you to focus on the areas where secure data is being used in your AWS CodeBuild projects.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  id,
  encryption_key
from
  aws_codebuild_build
where
  encryption_key is not null;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  id,
  encryption_key
from
  aws_codebuild_build
where
  encryption_key is not null;
```

### List complete builds
Explore which AWS CodeBuild projects have been fully built. This is useful for assessing project progress and identifying any projects that may still be in progress or have yet to begin.

```sql+postgres
