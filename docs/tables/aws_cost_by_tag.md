# Table: aws_cost_by_tag

Amazon Cost Explorer helps you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage. The `aws_cost_by_tag` table provides a simplified view of cost by tags in your account. One must specify a granularity (`MONTHLY`, `DAILY`) and `tag_key_1` to query the table, however, `tag_key_2` is optional.

Note that [pricing for the Cost Explorer API](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/) is per API request - Each request will incur a cost of $0.01.
