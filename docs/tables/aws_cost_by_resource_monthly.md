# Table: aws_cost_by_resource_monthly - Query AWS Cost Explorer Resource Costs using SQL

AWS Cost Explorer helps you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage. The Resource Cost feature provides detailed cost information at the individual resource level with monthly granularity, helping you identify specific resources that drive your AWS costs and understand long-term cost patterns.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_cost_by_resource_monthly` table provides insights into resource-level costs within AWS Cost Explorer with monthly granularity. This table allows you, as a financial analyst or cloud administrator, to query monthly cost details for specific AWS resources, helping you understand long-term spending patterns and identify cost optimization opportunities. The schema outlines various cost metrics including unblended cost, amortized cost, and usage quantity, along with resource identifiers and time periods.

**Important Notes**

- The [pricing for the Cost Explorer API](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/) is per API request - Each request you make will incur a cost of $0.01.
- By default, the table shows resource-level data with `dimension_key = 'LINKED_ACCOUNT'` and `dimension_value` set to the caller's AWS account ID for the last 14 days. To access monthly resource-level data beyond 14 days, you must enable **historical cost allocation data** in your AWS Cost Explorer settings, which extends data retention up to **38 months**.
- This table supports optional quals. Queries with optional quals are optimised to reduce query time and cost. Optional quals are supported for the following columns:
  - `resource_id` with supported operators `=` and `<>`.
  - `dimension_key` with supported operator `=`.
  - `dimension_value` with supported operator `=`.
  - `period_start` with supported operators `=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, and `<`.
  - `period_end` with supported operators `=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, and `<`.
