# Table: aws_cloudtrail_query

AWS CloudTrail Lake lets you run SQL-based queries on your events. CloudTrail Lake converts existing events in row-based JSON format to Apache ORC format. ORC is a columnar storage format that is optimized for fast retrieval of data.

Only queries from the past seven days are returned from the API. If you'd like to shorten the list of results, you can specify a specific `creation_time` and/or `query_status` in the query.

## Examples

### Basic info

```sql
select
  query_id,
  event_data_store_arn,
  query_status,
  query_status,
  creation_time,
  events_matched,
  events_scanned
from
  aws_cloudtrail_query;
```

### List queries that are failed

```sql
select
  query_id,
  event_data_store_arn,
  query_status,
  creation_time,
  query_string,
  execution_time_in_millis
from
  aws_cloudtrail_query
where
  query_status = 'FAILED';
```

### Get event data store details for the queries

```sql
select
  q.query_id as query_id,
  q.event_data_store_arn as event_data_store_arn,
  s.name as event_data_store_name,
  s.status as event_data_store_status,
  s.multi_region_enabled as multi_region_enabled,
  s.termination_protection_enabled as termination_protection_enabled,
  s.updated_timestamp as event_data_store_updated_timestamp
from
  aws_cloudtrail_query as q,
  aws_cloudtrail_event_data_store as s
where
 s.event_data_store_arn = q.event_data_store_arn;
```

## List queries created within the last 3 days

```sql
select
  query_id,
  event_data_store_arn,
  query_status,
  creation_time,
  query_string,
  execution_time_in_millis
from
  aws_cloudtrail_query
where
  creation_time <= now() - interval '3' day;
```
