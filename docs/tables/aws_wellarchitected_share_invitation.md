# Table: aws_wellarchitected_share_invitation

A share invitation is a request to share a workload or custom lens owned by another AWS account. A workload or lens can be shared with all users in an AWS account, individual users, or both. If you accept a workload invitation, the workload is added to your Workloads and Dashboard pages. If you accept a custom lens invitation, the lens is added to your Custom lenses page. If you reject the invitation, it's removed from the list.
