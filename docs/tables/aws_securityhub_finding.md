# Table: aws_securityhub_finding - Query AWS Security Hub Findings using SQL

The AWS Security Hub Findings is a feature within AWS Security Hub that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services. It also consolidates findings from different AWS services such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie, as well as from AWS Partner solutions. The findings are presented as potential security issues, such as insecure configurations or malicious activity.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_securityhub_finding` table in Steampipe provides you with information about security findings within AWS Security Hub. This table allows you as a security analyst or DevOps engineer to query details about identified security issues, including their severity, status, description, the resources affected, and any recommended remediation steps. You can utilize this table to gather insights on security vulnerabilities, such as open security groups, exposed access keys, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the security finding for you, including the finding ARN, ID, title, description, severity, and associated resources.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore the critical security findings in your AWS environment to understand their severity and level of confidence. This can help prioritize remediation efforts and improve overall security posture.

```sql+postgres
