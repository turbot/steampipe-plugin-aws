## Examples

### List of VPC endpoint and the corresponding services

select
  vpc_endpoint_id,
  vpc_id,
  service_name
from
  aws_vpc_endpoint;
```


### Subnet Id count for each VPC endpoints

```sql
select
  vpc_endpoint_id,
  jsonb_array_length(subnet_ids) as subnet_id_count
from
  aws_vpc_endpoint;
```


### Network details for each VPC endpoint

```sql
select
  vpc_endpoint_id,
  vpc_id,
  jsonb_array_elements(subnet_ids) as subnet_ids,
  jsonb_array_elements(network_interface_ids) as network_interface_ids,
  jsonb_array_elements(route_table_ids) as route_table_ids,
  sg ->> 'GroupName' as sg_name
from
  aws_vpc_endpoint
  cross join jsonb_array_elements(groups) as sg;
```


### DNS information for the VPC endpoints

```sql
select
  vpc_endpoint_id,
  private_dns_enabled,
  dns ->> 'DnsName' as dns_name,
  dns ->> 'HostedZoneId' as hosted_zone_id
from
  aws_vpc_endpoint
  cross join jsonb_array_elements(dns_entries) as dns;
```


### VPC endpoint count by VPC ID

```sql
select
  vpc_id,
  count(vpc_endpoint_id) as vpc_endpoint_count
from
  aws_vpc_endpoint
group by
  vpc_id;
```
