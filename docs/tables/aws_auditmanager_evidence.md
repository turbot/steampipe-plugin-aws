# Table: aws_auditmanager_evidence - Query AWS Audit Manager Evidence using SQL

The AWS Audit Manager Evidence is a component of AWS Audit Manager service that automates the collection and organization of evidence for audits. It simplifies the process of gathering necessary documents to demonstrate to auditors that your controls are operating effectively. This resource assists in continuously auditing your AWS usage to simplify risk assessment and compliance with regulations and industry standards.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_auditmanager_evidence` table in Steampipe provides you with information about evidence resources within AWS Audit Manager. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, to query evidence-specific details, including the source, collection method, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on evidence, such as the evidence state, evidence by type, and the AWS resource from which the evidence was collected. The schema outlines the various attributes of the evidence for you, including the evidence id, assessment id, control set id, evidence folder id, and associated tags.

## Examples

```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  arn,
  evidence_folder_id,
  evidence_by_type,
  iam_id,
  control_set_id
from
  aws_auditmanager_evidence;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  id,
  arn,
  evidence_folder_id,
  evidence_by_type,
  iam_id,
  control_set_id

  count(id) as evidence_count
from
  aws_auditmanager_evidence
group by
  evidence_folder_id;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
