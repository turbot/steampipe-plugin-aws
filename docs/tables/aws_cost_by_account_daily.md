## Examples

### Basic info
This example allows users to gain insights into their daily AWS cost by account. It's useful for tracking and analyzing cost trends over time, helping to manage and optimize cloud spending.

```sql+postgres
select
  linked_account_id,
  period_start,
  blended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  amortized_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  net_unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
  net_amortized_cost_amount::numeric::money
from 
  aws_cost_by_account_daily
order by
  linked_account_id,
  period_start;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  linked_account_id,
  period_start,
  CAST(blended_cost_amount AS REAL) AS blended_cost_amount,
  CAST(unblended_cost_amount AS REAL) AS unblended_cost_amount,
  CAST(amortized_cost_amount AS REAL) AS amortized_cost_amount,
  CAST(net_unblended_cost_amount AS REAL) AS net_unblended_cost_amount,
  CAST(net_amortized_cost_amount AS REAL) AS net_amortized_cost_amount
from 
  aws_cost_by_account_daily
order by
  linked_account_id,
  period_start;
```

### Min, Max, and average daily unblended_cost_amount by account
Analyze your AWS accounts to understand the minimum, maximum, and average daily costs. This is useful for monitoring the financial performance of different accounts and identifying potential areas for cost optimization.

```sql+postgres
select
  linked_account_id,
  min(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as min,
  max(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as max,
  avg(unblended_cost_amount)::numeric::money as average
from 
  aws_cost_by_account_daily
group by
  linked_account_id
order by
  linked_account_id;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  linked_account_id,
  min(unblended_cost_amount) as min,
  max(unblended_cost_amount) as max,
  avg(unblended_cost_amount) as average
from 
  aws_cost_by_account_daily
group by
  linked_account_id
order by
  linked_account_id;
```


### Ranked - Top 10 Most expensive days (unblended_cost_amount) by account
Explore the days where the cost was at its highest for each account. This query is useful for identifying potential anomalies or trends in spending, enabling more effective financial management.

```sql+postgres
with ranked_costs as (
  select
    linked_account_id,
    period_start,
    unblended_cost_amount::numeric::money,
    rank() over(partition by linked_account_id order by unblended_cost_amount desc)
  from 
    aws_cost_by_account_daily
)
select * from ranked_costs where rank <= 10;
```
