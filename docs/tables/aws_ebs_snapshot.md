# Table: aws_ebs_snapshot

An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time copy of Amazon EBS volume, which is copied to Amazon Simple Storage Service.

The `aws_ebs_snapshot` table lists all private snapshots by default.

**You can specify an owner alias, owner ID or snapshot ID** in the `where` clause (`where owner_alias=''`), (`where owner_id=''`) or (`where snapshot_id=''`) to list public or shared snapshots from a specific AWS account.

## Examples

### List of snapshots which are not encrypted

```sql
select
  snapshot_id,
  arn,
  encrypted
from
  aws_ebs_snapshot
where
  not encrypted;
```

### List of EBS snapshots which are publicly accessible

```sql
select
  snapshot_id,
  arn,
  volume_id,
  perm ->> 'UserId' as userid,
  perm ->> 'Group' as group
from
  aws_ebs_snapshot
  cross join jsonb_array_elements(create_volume_permissions) as perm
where
  perm ->> 'Group' = 'all';
```

### Find the Account IDs with which the snapshots are shared

```sql
select
  snapshot_id,
  volume_id,
  perm ->> 'UserId' as account_ids
from
  aws_ebs_snapshot
  cross join jsonb_array_elements(create_volume_permissions) as perm;
```

### Find the snapshot count per volume

```sql
select
  volume_id,
  count(snapshot_id) as snapshot_id
from
  aws_ebs_snapshot
group by
  volume_id;
```

### List snapshots owned by a specific AWS account

```sql
select
  snapshot_id,
  arn,
  encrypted,
  owner_id
from
  aws_ebs_snapshot
where
  owner_id = '859788737657';
```

### Get a specific snapshot by ID

```sql
select
  snapshot_id,
  arn,
  encrypted,
  owner_id
from
  aws_ebs_snapshot
where
  snapshot_id = 'snap-07bf4f91353ad71ae';
```

### List snapshots owned by Amazon (Note: This will attempt to list ALL public snapshots)

```sql
select
  snapshot_id,
  arn,
  encrypted,
  owner_id
from
  aws_ebs_snapshot
where
  owner_alias = 'amazon'
```
