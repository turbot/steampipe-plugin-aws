# Table: aws_cognito_identity_provider - Query AWS Cognito Identity Providers using SQL

The AWS Cognito Identity Provider is a feature of Amazon Cognito, a service that provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. It allows you to easily integrate third-party identity providers with your Cognito User Pools, enabling users to sign in using their existing social or enterprise identities. This simplifies the sign-in process for your users and can help increase engagement.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_cognito_identity_provider` table in Steampipe provides you with information about the identity provider configurations within AWS Cognito User Pools. This table allows you, as a DevOps engineer, security analyst, or developer, to query provider-specific details, including the provider name, type, attributes mapping, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on identity providers, such as understanding the identity providers linked to user pools, verifying attribute mappings, and more. The schema outlines the various attributes of the identity provider for you, including the provider name, creation date, user pool id, and attribute mapping.
