# Table: aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator - Query AWS Security Hub Finding Aggregator using SQL

The AWS Security Hub Finding Aggregator is a feature of AWS Security Hub that consolidates findings across multiple AWS accounts into a single AWS account. It enables centralized management and analysis of security findings, enhancing visibility into your security and compliance status. It uses SQL for querying, allowing you to filter and analyze security findings efficiently.

## Table Usage Guide

The `aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator` table in Steampipe provides you with information about the findings generated by the integrated third-party products and AWS services. This table allows you, as a security analyst or DevOps engineer, to query findings-specific details, including severity, resource details, and associated metadata. You can utilize this table to gather insights on findings, such as the types of findings, the resources involved, and the severity of the findings. The schema outlines the various attributes of the findings for you, including the finding ARN, creation date, compliance status, and associated tags.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore the settings of AWS Security Hub's finding aggregator to understand the linking mode between different regions and the region where findings are aggregated. This is useful for assessing the configuration of your security alerts and understanding how your security data is being managed across different geographical locations.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  finding_aggregation_region,
  region_linking_mode
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  finding_aggregation_region,
  region_linking_mode
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator;
```

### List finding aggregators linked to all regions
Identify the instances where all regions are linked to a specific finding aggregator in AWS SecurityHub. This can be useful for understanding how security findings are aggregated across different regions.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  finding_aggregation_region,
  region_linking_mode
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator
where
  region_linking_mode = 'ALL_REGIONS';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  finding_aggregation_region,
  region_linking_mode
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator
where
  region_linking_mode = 'ALL_REGIONS';
```

### List regions for finding aggregators that include specific regions
Determine the areas in which specific regions are included by aggregators in AWS Security Hub. This is useful for understanding the scope of your security findings and ensuring that relevant regions are not overlooked.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  region_linking_mode,
  r as linked_region
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(regions) as r
where
  region_linking_mode = 'SPECIFIED_REGIONS';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  region_linking_mode,
  json_extract(r.value, '$') as linked_region
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator,
  json_each(regions) as r
where
  region_linking_mode = 'SPECIFIED_REGIONS';
```

### List regions for finding aggregators that exclude specific regions
Determine the areas in which specific regions are excluded from the scope of AWS SecurityHub finding aggregators. This is useful in identifying any potential security blind spots in your regional coverage.

```sql+postgres
select
  arn,
  a.name as linked_region
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator as f,
  aws_region as a,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(f.regions) as r
where
  region_linking_mode = 'ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED'
and
  a.name <> r;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  arn,
  a.name as linked_region
from
  aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator as f,
  aws_region as a,
  json_each(f.regions) as r
where
  region_linking_mode = 'ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED'
  and a.name <> json_extract(r.value, '$');
```
